            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>I am a front-end web developer working out of Pittsburgh with a background in the I.T field. I have been around computers my entire life. I started working on personal Web Development projects that involve using modern techniques in the space today about a year ago.</p>
            <h2> Experience </h2>
            <p>I have worked in many field that have involved communicating and working in team environments. I find this to one of my strong suites. In development the ability to communicate is essential. It allows for the production of product to be done in the most seamless professional way possible. This allows me to transition into working with a group of people very efficiently and be productive right away.</p>
            <h2> Front-End Development </h2>
            <p>The Nature of Front-end development has been something that has been changing greatly over the years. It has gone from the days of just static HTML and CSS to fully built applications involving many different layers of code. These different layers allow everything to work in conjunction with each other and allow the user to have a well-rounded experience. This is why I find Front-End development to be an awesome fit you. This is due to my passion of allowing users to easily connect to products in ways that would not have been possible in the past.</p>
            <h2> Skills</h2>
            <p>
            I make responsive websites with cross browser compatibility for mobile, tablet , and desktop platforms.
